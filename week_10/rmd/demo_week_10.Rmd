# Dataset: Childhood diarrheal diseases in Mali

We will visualize distributions of numerical variables in the `malidd`
data frame, which we've seen in previous lessons.

```{r}
# Load in and view the `malidd` data frame
malidd <- read.csv(here::here("data/malidd.csv"))
head(malidd)
```

The dataframe has 21 variables, many of which are continuous, like
`height_cm`, `viral_load`, or `temp`.

```{r}
# Inspect variables
summary(malidd)
```

# Basic histograms with `geom_histogram()`

Now let's use {ggplot2} to plot the distribution of height.

```{r}
# Simple histogram showing the distribution of height_cm
ggplot(data =  malidd , 
       mapping = aes(x = height_cm)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

It's hard to get a sense for which range of heights is spanned by each
bin in the previous plot, since everything is one big amorphous blob. So
let's add borders around the bins:

```{r}
# Set border color to "white"
ggplot(data =  malidd , 
       mapping = aes(x = height_cm)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white")
```

We now have an easier time associating bin ranges to each of the bars.

# Comparing distributions

We can compare multiple distributions on the same axes.

For example, mapping a categorical variable to the **`fill`** aesthetic
will create **stacked** bars.

```{r}
# Map fill to sex
ggplot(data =  malidd , 
       mapping = aes(x = height_cm,
                     fill = sex)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

## Position adjustments

You can change the position adjustment within `geom_histogram()`.

![](images/gg_min_build.png)

Possible values for the argument **position** in `geom_histogram()` are
**`“stack”`**, **`“identity”`**, and **`“dodge”`**.

The default value is `“stack”`, so adding `position = "stack"` will give
the same plot.

```{r}
# stack: stacked distributions of a categorical variable  
ggplot(data =  malidd , 
       mapping = aes(x = height_cm, 
                     fill = sex,
                     color = sex)) +
  geom_histogram(position = "stack") + 
  labs(title = "position = 'stack'")
```

Setting `position = 'identity'` causes the bars to **overlap**. To see
that overlapping, we need to add make the bars slightly transparent by
decreasing opacity (`alpha`).

```{r}
# identity: draw overlapping distributions on the same plot
ggplot(data =  malidd , 
       mapping = aes(x = height_cm, 
                     fill = sex,
                     color = sex)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.4, 
                 position = "identity") + 
  labs(title = "position = identity")
```

Setting `position = "dodge"` places overlapping bars **directly beside
one another**. This makes it easier to compare values.

```{r}
# dodge: interweave distributions on the same plot
ggplot(data =  malidd , 
       mapping = aes(x = height_cm, 
                     fill = sex,
                     color = sex)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.4, 
                 position = "dodge") + 
  labs(title = "position = 'dodge'")
```

## Faceting plots

Another way to add additional variables is to split your plot into
**facets**.

When we **facet** a graphs, it gets split up into **multiple panels**,
one for each level of a categorical variable.

![Faceting creates small multiples of a plot, where each panel contains
a subset of the data.](images/gglayers_facet.png){width="500"}

```{r}
# Base plot
ggplot(data = malidd, 
       mapping = aes(x= viral_load))+
    geom_histogram(color="white")
```

### Facet wrap

To facet your plot by a single variable, use `facet_wrap()`. The first
argument of `facet_wrap()` should be a formula, which you create with
`~` followed by a variable name. The variable that you pass to
`facet_wrap()` should be discrete.

```{r}
# Facet by fever
ggplot(data = malidd, 
       mapping = aes(x= viral_load))+
    geom_histogram(color="white")+
    facet_wrap(~fever)
```

Facets are labelled by the difference values of your categorical
variable, (e.g., 1 and 0) and not by the variable name itself (e.g.,
fever).

Facet labels can be modified using the `labeller` argument. Setting it
to `label_both` will give both the variable name and the value.

```{r}
# Add more informative panel labels
ggplot(data = malidd, 
       mapping = aes(x= viral_load)) +
    geom_histogram(color="white") +
    facet_wrap(~fever, 
               labeller = label_both)
```

### Facet grid

To facet your plot on the combination of two variables, we use
`facet_grid()`. This time the formula should contain two variable names
separated by a `~`.

```{r}
# Facet by fever and vomiting
ggplot(data = malidd, 
       mapping = aes(x= viral_load)) +
    geom_histogram(color="white") +
    facet_grid(fever ~ vomit, 
               labeller = label_both)
```
