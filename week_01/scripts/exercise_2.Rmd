For each of the datasets below, try to describe in words how you would

Jot down your answers and submit them as a comment

For each of the following datasets, describe in words the best way you can think of to perform the analyses. This could be either:

-   How you would do it if you had to do it manually?

-   Or how you would do it using a spreadsheet software like Excel

-   Or how you would do it with another data analysis software that you know (STATA, SPSS)

-   Or some combination of the above.

At the end of the lesson, I will show you the R code for each of these.

1.  Attempts data for three quizzes. How would you count the number of people who have passed at least two quizzes?

# Data viz

Critique each of the following data visualizations below. They are listed roughly in increasing order of badness!

In what ways are they not ideal? How might they be improved?

-   Why use abbreviation?

-   Not how mean and SD data should be presented

## **3. Confirmed COVID cases in Florida**

-   No need for color axix

-   Most of the graph is wasted space

-   More data needed for context

## 4. Pet ownership percentages

-   Presented as compositional data but it is actually univariate numerical data

-   Not how such data should be presented.
